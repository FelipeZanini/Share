# __Share Knowledge__

Share Knowledge is a project designed for book lovers who want to share their stories and hear fascinating stories told by those who love them the most, with each member briefly describing their chosen book and what they thought of it, then each member has the opportunity to share their books among each other.
Being a means to gather readers from all over Dublin, the Share Knowledge project is a  mixed theme book club, so it achieves broad horizons of reading, to broaden the knowledge horizons of the members, furthermore, the Share Knowledge project aims at the member's socialization through the power of reading.

### Features Left to Implement
-   Would be a good idea to implement a gallery page with the photos of our meets.
-   Would be great to have a  page with a complete book collection to be shared among the community.

## Testing
-   I conducted several tests on the program during development, at first the website was made for a screen of 1300 pixels wide and for this reason, I had several problems achieving responsive design.  I had to change the navigation link to the centre, and also changed the size of the "Join Us Section" element a few times to better respond to different types of screens, however the most challenging was changing the "Reason Section" elements; I used flexbox to style it, but when the screen shrank I had numerous design breaks on the page, although changing the margin, width and font size of the elements for multiple screen sizes I could manage it, achieving a responsive design, I just had few problems changing the "MeetUp Section" and the "Footer Section", It was only necessary to change the height and font size were enough, while the "Sign Up" page required changes in the position and width of the fieldset.
